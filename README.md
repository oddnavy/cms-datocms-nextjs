# A Inlight website example using Next.js and DatoCMS


## How to use

### Quick start

### Local setup

Once the setup of the project and repo is done, clone the repo locally.

#### Set up environment variables

In your DatoCMS' project, go to the **Settings** menu at the top and click **API tokens**.

Then click **Read-only API token** and copy the token.

Next, copy the `.env.example` file in this directory to `.env` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```


#### Run your project locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your website should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
